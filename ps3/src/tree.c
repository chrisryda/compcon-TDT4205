   * This is the most classic form of constant folding.

   * the calculation can be performed at compile time, and the whole expression can be replaced
   * by 24.
   *
   * In our compiler, a value is known at compile time if it is a NUMBER_LITERAL node.
   * If all children of an OPERATOR node have this type, we can perform the operation on the
   * numbers. The OPERATOR node can then be replaced with a NUMBER_LITERAL node holding the result
   * as its data.
   *
   * Remember:
   *  - the values of NUMBER_LITERALs are stored in number_node->data.number_literal.
   *  - the operator of an OPERATOR node is stored in the field node->data.operator, and is a
   * string.
   *
   * Checking if a string is equal to another string can be done using strcmp(str1, str2), which
   * returns 0 if the strings are identical.
